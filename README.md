Tac-Calc ⭐ – Our First Semester's Project

For our first-semester C-programming project, we wanted to create something that challenged us and reflected everything we had learned. While many suggested building simple games or basic systems, we decided to combine all the ideas we received into one project – Tac-Calc.

Tac-Calc is a terminal-based program where players earn points by playing Tic-Tac-Toe. These points are stored in a database using File I/O in C and can be used for calculations, matrix operations, and solving resistive circuits.

This project allowed us to apply everything we learned in C, all in one place. A big thanks to my teammates Anup Joshi, Crystal Khanal, and Ishant Yadav for their hard work and dedication. We’re proud of what we accomplished and the experience we gained! 🙌!
