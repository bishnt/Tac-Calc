While many suggested building simple games or basic systems, we decided to combine all the ideas we received into one project â€“ Tac-Calc.

Tac-Calc is a terminal-based program where players earn points by playing Tic-Tac-Toe. These points are stored in a database using File I/O in C and can be used for calculations, matrix operations, and solving resistive circuits.

This project allowed us to apply everything we learned in C, all in one place. A big thanks to my teammates Anup Joshi, Crystal Khanal, and Ishant Yadav for their hard work and dedication. Weâ€™re proud of what we accomplished and the experience we gained! ðŸ™Œ
