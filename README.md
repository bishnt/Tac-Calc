# Tal-Calc
For our first-semester C-programming project, we received a lot of advice from seniors and peers. Some suggested creating a simple game, others recommended a basic management system, and a few even said, "Keep it easy; the professor wonâ€™t check it thoroughly." But we wanted to create something that would challenge us and reflect everything we had learned so far.

After considering all the ideas we received, we decided to combine them into one comprehensive project â€“ "tac-calc". Itâ€™s a terminal-based program where players earn points by playing a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, and those points are stored in a database created using File I/O in C. The points can then be used to perform calculations, solve matrix operations, and even work through resistive circuits.

This project gave us the opportunity to apply everything we've learned this semester in C, all in one place.

A big thanks to my teammates Anup Joshi, Crystal Khanal, and Ishant Yadav for their dedication and teamwork. Weâ€™re proud to have completed this project and gained so much from the experience! ðŸ™Œ
